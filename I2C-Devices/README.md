# I2C-Devices
A collection of various I2C device implementations along with some 
generic stuff and test applications to illustrate how to use the devices.

The code has almost no documentation, but hopefully it will be self-explanatory 
if you read the related datasheet.

In the 'I2c-Devices/distribution' folder, you will find ready-compiled jar files for download.
